As a result, legacy modernization is not only more critical\u2013but also more urgent\u2013than ever.\n\nJoin us to explore how we are using a combination of deterministic techniques and AI to identify the core business capabilities buried within legacy systems. By uncovering \u201cseams\u201d in the code, we decompose modernization into manageable \u201cthin slices\u201d that can be delivered incrementally. This approach democratises modernization by providing continuous value and feedback throughout the journey\u2013rather than deferring ROI until the end of a multi-year transformation programme.",

        "Final abstract (Max. 150 words)": "As developers use AI agents to generate Terraform configurations, ensuring compliance with internal policies becomes a critical challenge. This talk presents a new approach: integrating an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that connects AI agents with existing OPA (Open Policy Agent) policies. By querying these policies, the server extracts real-time constraints\u2014such as allowed instance types, required tags, or open ports\u2014and feeds them back into the generation prompt. This allows developers to request infrastructure in natural language (\u201cI need a server on AWS\u201d) and receive compliant Terraform code by default. The session includes a prototype demo and explores how this pattern bridges policy, AI, and Infrastructure as Code inside modern developer workflows.",

We'll explore concrete examples of how these techniques can lead to more robust, maintainable code and a significantly more collaborative team environment, leaving with actionable strategies to implement TDD and pairing, empowering you to improve their coding practices and team dynamics and ways to elevate the team's collaborative power.

        "Final abstract (Max. 150 words)": "Many legacy rewrite projects end up not delivering the expected benefits, while the legacy is still running and keeping the business alive.\n\nAn alternative is to port & mend the legacy code. We may need to adapt it to new hardware, modern libraries or new operating systems. \"\"Porting\"\" means taking the old code and making the minimal changes necessary to make it run in a new home. \n\n\"\"Mending\"\" is the humble act of giving old code some respect and care; fixing what needs fixing, refactoring what needs refactoring, and being happy when it comes back to life: maintainable, deployable, updatable and well tested.\n\nThere's a place for all approaches; sometimes a rewrite is what's needed, but often a simple \"\"port & mend\"\" approach is applicable, and when it is, it's less risky and cheaper. Advances in AI are making port & mend much cheaper and more accessible. \n\nThis talk is based on actual experience.",

This talk offers a blueprint for enterprises ready to unlock the full potential of Generative AI agents.\n\nWe'll delve into the essential platform capabilities needed to support the entire agent lifecycle, from service creation and deployment to robust evaluations and fine-tuning. This platform empowers product teams to organically create and share AI tools and agents, enriching existing offerings and making them discoverable company-wide.\n\nWe'll also spotlight the Model Context Protocol (MCP) and show how it allows various AI agents to work together seamlessly throughout your organization. To round things out, we'll tackle the enterprise challenges you can't ignore \u2013 security, auditing, and practical governance that enables rather than blocks innovation.",
